    "The `torch.autograd` package provides classes and functions implementing automatic differentiation of arbitrary scalar valued functions.\n",

    "This notebook assumes that you are using **PyTorch version 1.3 or above**.\n",
    "In some of the previous versions (e.g. before 0.4), Tensors had to be wrapped in `torch.autograd.Variable` objects to enable autograd;\n",
    "however this class has now been deprecated and merged with `torch.Tensor`.\n",
    "In addition 1.0 also separates a Tensor's datatype from its device, and uses numpy-style factories for constructing Tensors rather than directly invoking Tensor constructors.\n",
    "Now, to obtain gradients for a tensor via autograd from arbitrary scalar valued functions, you can simply set `requires_grad=True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `torch.nn` package defines a set of Modules, which you can think of as a neural network layer that has produces output from input and may have some trainable weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also find the detailed [API doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) here.\n",
    "If you have other questions that are not addressed by the API docs, the [PyTorch forum](https://discuss.pytorch.org/) is a much better place to ask than StackOverflow.\n"

    "# Part III. PyTorch Module API\n",
    "\n",
    "Barebone PyTorch requires that we track all the parameter tensors by hand. This is fine for small networks with a few tensors, but it would be extremely inconvenient and error-prone to track tens or hundreds of tensors in larger networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch provides the `nn.Module` API for you to define arbitrary network architectures, while tracking every learnable parameters for you. In Part II, we implemented SGD ourselves. PyTorch also provides the `torch.optim` package that implements all the common optimizers, such as RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adam. It even supports approximate second-order methods like L-BFGS! You can refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html) for the exact specifications of each optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Module API, follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Subclass `nn.Module`. Give your network class an intuitive name like `TwoLayerFC`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the constructor `__init__()`, define all the layers you need as class attributes. Layer objects like `nn.Linear` and `nn.Conv2d` are themselves `nn.Module` subclasses and contain learnable parameters, so that you don't have to instantiate the raw tensors yourself. `nn.Module` will track these internal parameters for you. Refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html) to learn more about the dozens of builtin layers. **Warning**: don't forget to call the `super().__init__()` first!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the `forward()` method, define the *connectivity* of your network. You should use the attributes defined in `__init__` as function calls that take tensor as input and output the \"transformed\" tensor. Do *not* create any new layers with learnable parameters in `forward()`! All of them must be declared upfront in `__init__`. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you define your Module subclass, you can instantiate it as an object and call it just like the NN forward function in part II.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module API: Two-Layer Network\n",
    "Here is a concrete example of a 2-layer fully connected network.\n",
    "We use `nn.init.kaiming_normal_` to initialize weights using Kaiming initialization, and `nn.init.zeros_` to initialize biases."
